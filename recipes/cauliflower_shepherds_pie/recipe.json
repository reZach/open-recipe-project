        "Preheat the oven to 425F.",
        "In a small saucepan, combine sliced garlic, whole sprigs of rosemary and olive oil over low heat - steep with preparing other components for about 15-20 minutes. Strain and resereve oil when ready.",
        "Combine cauliflower florets and quaratered potato in a pot and cover with cold water. Season with a pinch of salt, bring to a boil annd let simmer until tender and can be easily mashed with a spoon - about 15-20 minutes.",
        "While cauliflower and potatoes are cooking, preheat a larage cast iron skillet on medium-high heat, add 1 tbsp of olive oil and ground beef - cook until beef is heavily browned - about 10-12 minutes.",
        "Remove beef from pan, add 1 tbsp of olive oil and the remaining vegetables, except corn - season with a pinch of salt and black pepper. Saute vegetables until lightly browned yet still firm.",
        "While vegetables are cooking, strain the cauliflower/potato mix and add to a stand mixer or large bowl. Whip until mixture is fluffy and smooth. Drizzle in the infused olive oil and season to taste with salt and black pepper - reserve while filling is prepared.",
        "Once vegetables are browned, add minced rosemary - stir to combine.",
        "Add tomato paste anad cook for 1 minute. Add all-purpose flour and cook for an additional minute.",
        "Add beef stock, stir and allow mixture to come to a simmer and thicken slightly. You want the mixture to have absorbed the majority of the liquid while still a bit loose",
        "Remove from heat, add corn, minced parsley and mix - season to taste.",
        "Add dollops of the cauliflower mash on top of the filling and spread in an even layer - ensure crust goes to the edges of the pan to prevent filling from bubbling over.",
        "Bake shepherd's pie in the oven for 25 minutes - finish with the broiler for the last 10 minutes until the top is golden brown.",
        "Allow finished shepherd's pie to cool for 5 minutes. Serve with minced parsley and enjoy!"
